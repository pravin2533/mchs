            <p class="the-dream-of">
              The dream of pursuing higher education in prestigious universities
              across the globe is often impeded by two daunting challenges:
              standardized tests like the GRE, SAT, TOEFL, and IELTS, and the
              complex and lengthy admission process for international students.
              To address these challenges, I established Dilip Oak’s Academy in
              1996 with the mission to assist deserving students in overcoming
              these hurdles and realizing their academic aspirations.<br />Our
              ultimate goal at Dilip Oak’s Academy is to serve as the gateway to
              higher education overseas, providing a solid foundation for future
              success for students from all backgrounds, including those from
              middle-class and lower-middle-class families. We strive to ensure
              that no deserving student is denied the opportunity to pursue
              their dream of studying abroad due to these obstacles.<br />Through
              our comprehensive training and support services, we aim to equip
              students with the skills and knowledge needed to excel in their
              standardized tests, navigate the admission process, and ultimately
              secure admission to their dream university. Our team of
              experienced and dedicated educators is committed to providing
              personalized guidance and support to each student, ensuring that
              they are well-prepared and confident to tackle these
              challenges.<br />At Dilip Oak’s Academy, we believe that education
              is the key to unlocking a bright and prosperous future, and we are
              dedicated to helping our students achieve their full potential.

              Whilst studying at a foreign university is an excellent option, it
              intrigues the prospective student with many a variety of
              questions. Your doubts start right from scratch as “What course
              should I do?”; Which country should I study in?”; “Should I go to
              a University or a College?” to some of the finer points such as,
              “Will I get a Good Job after completing the course?”; “Will it fit
              my budget?” etc.<br />These queries cannot be answered better by
              anyone than those who have “been there and done that”. Yes, our
              handpicked teams of counselors themselves have gone through the
              grind of studying abroad and have first-hand experiences to share
              with you, the prospective applicants. They know not only what
              courses you have the options to choose from, but also the best
              food around campus, the culture, and any and every detail you
              would need of your future alma mater.
